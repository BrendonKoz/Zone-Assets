2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	Hey davee, I have somewhat more important things at the moment, stop being all righteous for a moment.
6	gbvets	Detrimental	<< Leaving Chat >>
6	%refmania	Detrimental	<< Leaving Chat >>
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	Now..
2		drdavee	yeah your more important thing is to fuck us over by us not being able to see our chat
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	as far as Ak1 is concerned, I couldn't do much while he was an active player in a match - regardless, everyone should know to ignore him by now - and yes it is a problem, but not one that I can
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	easily see or correct
2		drdavee	sorry if i can't stop what i am doing with ball to put him on ignore
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	 ?ignore Ak1
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	not hard...
2		drdavee	but you have way too many people complaining about it now
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	And absolutely no way to verify.

2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	Sorry if I want to help the league...if I did something to Ak1, I'm sure Beelze would remove me as a ref.
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	I'd rather try to circumvent that, AND Ak1 at the same time, so told all refs to tell people to put him on ignore.
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	I didn't think he'd be stupid enough to spam his opponents' chat, so for that I apologize.
2		drdavee	then if beelz did something to you go over beelz
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	I'm not much of a stooley.

2		drdavee	this league is turning into all about SPC
2		drdavee	this isn't IGBL anymore
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	what was last week with SPC?
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	this league has always been a dictatorship
2		drdavee	either last week or week before where the refs refused to pull someobdy out on SPC for skipping iwth the ball twice
9			Entering: Mental Armor
2		drdavee	cost klesko the game
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	I was reffing a different match at that time.
6	gbvets	Aeth`	<< Entering Chat >>
6	gbvets	Gambler	<< Leaving Chat >>
2		drdavee	right which proves that all the refs are dickless when it comes to Beelz's squad
6	gbvets	Gambler	<< Entering Chat >>
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	Refs have been instructed to not be aggressive this season when it comes to spectating players for lag due to the crappy servers.
2		drdavee	if you want to be someobdys little bitch then fine watch the league go down
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	regardless, I have already pulled 2 players myself thus far
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	Sorry, but I don't take that tone lightly, davee.
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	tread carefully
2		drdavee	bet you niether of them are on spc
2		drdavee	oh so let me get this straight.. you refuse to do anything to AK1
2		drdavee	but when it is someobdy not on SPC you are finnally doing your job
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	Ak1 didn't disrespect me directly.
2		drdavee	u know what, you aren't even worth it anymore
2	drdavee	IGBL[Ref]_Realm	and THIS is visible to me.
