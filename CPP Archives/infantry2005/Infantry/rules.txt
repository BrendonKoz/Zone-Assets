~B~1Infantry/Cosmic Rift Rules (last updated: March 21, 2005)

~B~0Before playing Infantry or Cosmic Rift, you are presented with a License 
Agreement to which you've agreed to, making you responsible to abide by the 
further elaborated game-specific rules listed in this document. While these 
rules may not cover absolutely everything, they do provide a good grounding 
to the reader as to what is expected of them while enjoying the games.

The rules in the game are enforced by volunteer Guides and Moderators. 
Outside of enforcing these rules, any Guide or Moderator may come upon a 
disruptive activity that he/she deems worthy of acting upon. If you are 
punished for something not listed in these rules, it is a good idea to send 
an email to ~Bactiongames@soe.sony.com~B (Subject line: Infantry or Cosmic 
Rift) reporting the occurence. This helps us to both monitor abuse by 
Moderators and incorporate unwritten activities to this list of rules. In 
most cases, Moderators will apply punishment to specific offenses using the 
steps of punishment escalation shown at the bottom of this page. For more 
information on Moderators, see the "Moderators List" in your F1/Help menu.

The rules are organized into two sections: Game-based and Chat-based.

The following are activities that you are not permitted to do and will be 
moderated:

some effect on your gameplay (e.g., health, rate of fire, speed, weapons,

their (or your) bounty, better their (or your) kills to deaths ratio, 
experience, repeated deaths to collect helmets (your own or not), logging

inflating a players score.

force drop the flag you are holding, switching to Spectator Mode to force

cooperation with a friend on the opposing team.

~1Exception(s):

lag/latency (also known as "Lag-Flagging").~B

~1Note(s):
~0-The abovementioned lag limits do not only apply to flagging. In any zone, 
a Moderator that sees your lag as being disruptive to games will use those 
limits.
