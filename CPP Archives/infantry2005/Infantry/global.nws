             -I:RPG Beta Update

              Regrettably, I:RPG Beta has been pushed back to August 30th due to numerous issues that cropped up as the skill
              vendor system was being put in.  This is going to necessitate a partial re-design and re-focus of the zone. 
              However, let us stress that it IS coming, and WILL be up as soon as humanly possible.

             -Map and Zone Rotations Galor!

              Small Unit Tactics is up in place of CTFX.  HardCorps! is now using the Boarding Action map.

             -Season 7 Map Poll is up!

              Over at the CTFPL home, Z trigger has posted that the Season 7 map poll is up for your voting pleasure.  If you
              are part of the CTFPL and have played through a whole season, you qualify for voting.  Head on over to:

~B             Skirmish News~B

             -Updates Updates Updates!

              SK zones were updated with the following new classes: Engineer and Assault Trooper. Engineers get to place
              Barricades and Senty guns, and get to drive and repair vehicles.  Assault Trooper is a special close assault
              unit armed for close range combat.  This class models the elite Assault Marine and Sturmjagers of the Collective
              Military and the Titan Militia respectively.

              In Mechanized Skirmish the new Javelin MBT makes it's first appearance.  This homegrown battle tank helps the
              Titan Militia even the playing field when encountering Collective Tridents.

              Also worth noting is the class ranks have changed and the class groupings and required EXP has been juggled
              around a wee bit to reflect the actual overall effectiveness of the classes.

              Captain is coming, as are Ammo Dumps for command classes, stay tuned!

            -Alias Transfers on Hold!

             Joe is currently wading through a backlog of alias tranfers. For now, all alias transfers are on hold till he
             can wade through the current batch.  Please be patient and not rude and he will get to your requests.

            -Beta Update!

             Due to some serious problems that have arisen (and Yankee getting strep)  Beta is going slower than anticipated.
             Because of some of the problems encountered, some of the RPG slanted content may not be put in, which means that
             the focus will shift somewhat to the RTS portion of the zone design.  The should have little affect on the fun, 
             however. More news as it becomes available.

             Tired of seeing the Titan Militia take a beating due to inferior vehicles? Worry no more!  The Javelin
             Main Battle Tank is set to blitz the battlefield and provide Titan with some serious armored support that
             can handle a Trident on more equal terms.

             Also coming down the pike for SK:

             Engineers: Engineers will replace drivers in SK, they will be able
             to repair damaged vehicles, and they will be able to place a sentry gun.

             Assault Trooper:  Trooper armed with assault armor, grenades, chainsword and dual auto pistols for
             serious close range mayhem.

             Captain:  Captains will be able to call in orbital strikes of particle beams or off map artillery.

             Also, Sergeants will be getting a new ability, and that is the creation of an "Ammo Dump". The Ammo
             Dump will allow players to top off their ammo.  They are also destroyable because, well, it IS an Ammo
             Dump and they DO tend to explode when you toss a grenade on them.

             Stay Tuned!

            -USL Gearing Up For Season 8!

              As many of you are aware the games were in Stand Alone mode for a couple days starting Sunday.  Because of this unfortunate
              bit of downtime, many league matches were not played or postponed.  Most leagues have already posted makeup information on 
              their respective www sites.

              Several Zones on the zone list have been marked as [Free]. What this means is that guests playing in these zones will

            don't like to limit our guest players in this manner,  but it is necessary while we work on a patch for
            the game.  As soon as it is okay to do so, guests will be allowed further zone access. This hacker issue
            will be dealt with as soon as possible and we will move on just as we have in previous instances of hacks.

         for the next tourney.

        -Rift Ball sees more tweaking.

         Rift Ball was adjusted recently.  The "No-Rep" defensive properties were removed from the defense zones.  This 
         seems to keep the games pace up and seems to meet the defensive and offensive minded players halfway.  The new
         deeper defensive areas will be added to all goals on all RB maps.

        -Arachnae ships are named.

         The Arachnae ships have been named.  Since the Arachnae have never attempted contact with the Great Races, and all 
         attempts at doing so are met with hostility, the Terran nicknames have been used.

        -Chaos zone tuning changes:

         all ships lateral thrust settings were tuned a tad bit.
         Defender dual laser cannon projectiles do less outer damage.
         

        -Riftball zone tuning changes:

         Defense zones were configured so that a ship in the defense zone cannot be repulsed out of it.
         Repulsors were adjusted so that they pushed enemies with less force, and for a shorter duration.

        -Sign ups are still open for CRPL 5!

         Don't forget that there is still time to sign up for CRPL 5.  This is sure to be another great action packed season

        -I:CTF gets a new map!

         This Friday (11/21) there will be a new map for I:CTF!  This new map is very similar to Twin Peaks, with lifts
         and multi level buildings as well as an underground area.  Be sure to try it out!

        -Vehicle Testing to begin soon in I:RPG.

         Testing on the Landnaut has started and it should be making an appearance in I:RPG in the near future. The Landnaut
         is the first of several vehicles that are planned for the zone.

        -Hacked fan sites.

         Be careful visiting Station Pass related fan sites.  Recently, Voidsix had their forums hacked, redirecting users
         and installing a trojan+keylogger on their computers.  Be VERY careful visiting fansites, and make sure you have
         your service packs loaded, and your antivirus/adware updated.

        -Gravball Radio!

         According to Beelzebub, IGBL head freak:

         "The Gravball Radio Network has taken off. Using teamspeak, so far there are 2 weekly programs which
         are a great sucess, both in production and popularity.  "Around the Ball", an audio show modelled
         after ESPN's "Around the Horn" and hosted by Peregrin Took. Panelists score points arguing over
         various Gravball related topics, had it's 1st official episode Saturday (technically the one the week
         before was a rehersal). Shuma Gorath won it.  The other GB audio program is match commentary organised
         by drdavee. All GB matches will have playbyplay and colour commentators calling the action and offering
         insight. All of week 1's matches were a great sucess.  Their site (pretty spartan atm) is hosted by GBIO
         and located here: (http://www.guardedlies.net/gbrn/)

         Recordings of the matches and Around the Ball episodes are available.  GB is really energized at the moment.
         The new season looks very competitive with 6 of the 9 squads having genuine shots at the championship and are
         very equal in skill. Public play is back up to around 50 people a night, and there's a ton of enthusiasm
         which is resulting in stuff like the audio programs."

        Last Friday an event was scheduled for the event server, but the scheduled event, TANK WARS!, had to be 
        cancelled due to a server bug.  The bug was squashed, but not in time.  A new organised event will be 
        scheduled, but in the near term the event server has been left up and open to the subscribing public with
        the TANK WARS! configuration.

        Something new for I:RPG is being tested in Yankee's room.  It is the new ~BFCU~B, or Field Control Unit.  Field
        Control units are required to control Tier 1 automated units.  All tier 1 automated units will require that
        they be placed within 1024 pixels of an ~BFCU~B.  IF the ~BFCU~B is destroyed or goes offline due to damage, then
        all controlled automated units will go dormant until such time as the ~BFCU~B is repaired or replaced with a new
        ~BFCU~B.  This should add a new layer of complexity and result in more interesting base layouts.

        Several types of currency are also being tested. As they are phased into the I:RPG alpha, certain items, like
        helmets, will be phased out.  Rest assured trophy hunters, there are items coming to replace helmets. Initially,
        helmets will be replaced with Rank badges, so if you kill a basic class, you will get a basic rank badge when you
        pick up a basic class helmet.  Rank badges will be worth credits/exp at certain vendors. In order to create some
        level of risk to dying, these players will drop a portion of their rank badges/new currency types when they die.

        Several new weapons are being worked on, the first of which will appear are the new secondary ammo's for Shotguns.
        When this update goes in Engineer and Biochem will lose access to the Battle Rifle class of weapons.

        Last but not least, the first of several new vehicles for I:RPG will be testing soon. Be prepared to face the
        armor of the Landnaut!

        Final Layout has been completed on the new CTF map and will be going up on a server near you soon!
        The new Desert Themed SK maps are nearing finalproduction and should be up soon as well.

         large and complex map.

         flags a team holds and the number of players in the arena.

         dating back to 2001. Expect a recycle or 3 when the zone comes up.

        Admissions were extended for the CTFPL Maklov Open Tourney due to the

        Gravball is sporting a new map, courtesy of Weltch and a new set of teams.  Please come and check out the Zealots versus the Hornets!!

        [I:RPG] will be getting a tuning update on Wednesday evening. The delay was do to having to revert to a previous version of the [I:RPG]
        dev master by ripping out some completed systems. :) This update will address many current gameplay issues. Also the Dev Diary will
        be updated with lists of planned systems as they are intended to be implemented.  Many ambiguous pieces of the game will be made clear.

        Infantry-Sector hosted an impromptu event in Boom Ball X.  Many players decided to come and play some quick games.
        Thanks Marine+ and I-Sector!

        Boom Ball x is scheduled to receive some map and gameplay updates on Thursday the 31st.  The updates will include 
        changes to the move model, weapons, and the map.  There will be a couple of new weapons as well.

        NMLTL had the championship match this evening between Unit Eternal and Nostalgia.  Unit Eternal won 2-0-1.
        Congrats to both teams for a fun match and thanks to all who attended!

        CTFPL games were disrupted due to Launchpad errors, so many matches are being rescheduled.  Do not forget to submit
        your map ideas for CTFPL maps.  Head over to http://ctfpl.infantry-sector.com/ for details.

        Cosmic Rift was updated. The update consisted of various small tweaks to the Arachnae weapons.  Be sure to try out your 
        favorite Arachnae ship and see what you think.

        The Arachnae naming event is set to re-open next Monday of next week.  5 names will be listed for each ship class and
        the players will vote to decide which name is used.

        Cosmic Rift Riftball has a new map, new ship setup and new teams!  The map was created by 7hm, and features the
        Polaris Pilots versus the Arcturus Blasters!

        Due to scheduling issues, Cosmic Rift Players League has not completed Pre-Season Round 3.  Keep your eyes on the forums or

	New version released today, fixes a few bugs and adds a new advanced-option to the game.  The new option option allows you to configure the game to flip-pages off the vertical blanking interval (VBI), which can improve performance substantially on some machines (particularly on GeForce cards).  I recommend you give it a try and see if it helps.  On some video cards you may see an effect they refer to as tearing.

	The new scoring system is finally here.  Under the 'Charts...' menu you will find several new options that will guide you through accessing the new scoring features.  For all the details of the new system, see the Release Notes (under F1 help)

	Basically, the new scoring system tracks a players performance on daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and lifetime basis.  Players can view the historical data in various ways.

	As far as score resets go, we wanted to make sure all the new features are working and tracking properly before we reset everything and start with a clean slate.  We will let you know in advance when we plan on resetting everything.

	Finally, if you are having problems with your game-controller, you need to:
		1) install DirectX 8.0 (you can download it free from www.microsoft.com/directx)
		2) go to the Movement Configuration menu from the zone-selection screen and configure your controller (or mouse) appropriately
		3) go to the Keyboard/Button Configuration menu and make sure all your controller buttons are setup as desired.

	We will be shutting down the game tomorrow morning from 9:00 a.m. until Noon (Pacific Time) while we make some changes to the database structure.  We may have the game operating in stand-alone mode during that time, or we may shut it down completely (we will see).

	When the game comes back live there will be a new version released.  The scores WILL NOT be wiped at that time.  In fact, from the users perspective nothing will have changed.  For the curious though, internally it will be tracking scores very differently.  The reason we are rolling out the new scoring system in two phases is so we can test the backend (server-side) stuff for bugs and load-handling before we put further stress on it by having users querying the new functionality.  This will also allow us to fully develop the front-end interface to the new features against real data before we release it live.  The net effect should be that your scores won't be wiped until we are 100% sure everything is working.

	Once we are sure that everything is working, we will be wiping the scores clean and doing another version that contains the full client-side functionality of the new scoring system.  Assuming the load-testing goes ok, this will likely happen Thursday or Friday.

	We will most likely be resetting all scores for all zones the middle of next week.  This will coincide with the next release which will be implementing a slightly modified scoring system (early testing shows the system should work).

	We will be giving more details on the scoring system at the time of the release, but the new system should prevent the need from us having to reset the scores again, and yet will provide newer players that come into established zone the opportunity to set themselves apart from the pack.

	There are a couple implications of the score wipe that you should be aware of.  First off, you since your squad-membership and banners are kept in the score-chart with your score on a per-zone basis, that information will be lost.  
	
	For squads, you will simply need to rejoin your squad, so make sure you know the squad password (which will be the same as before, as will the owner of the squad).  For banners, you should go to the banner edit screen and export your banner to a local file, then you will be able to re-import it after the score-wipe has occurred.

	Your aliases will all remain in tact, as will any squads that have been created (you will just need to rejoin them).  Your total usage will remain the same. In zones that track experience, skills, cash, and inventory, those will likely be reset as well (not decided yet, but starting clean seems like a good idea).

	If you are interested in keeping a long term record of the current high-score charts, I recommend you export a copy of them sometime soon as we will not be keeping the data.  As next week rolls around, I will give more details of precisely when the wipe will occur, so you can grab the latest charts just before the wipe.

	When we do wipe, we will likely have to shut down the servers for a little while (up to an hour perhaps).  We will take care to schedule this downtime in the morning hours, and warn people the night before.

	Finally, please quit bugging us and the mods about when the wipe will occur, as soon as we have everything in place and know when the wipe will be, we will post it to the zone news.

	Some people will think the new scoring system is a lot of fuss about nothing, others will think it is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I am very excited about the new score system if for no other reason than it will help new players to the game get incorporated into the community more quickly.

	Thanks for playing our game, we will continue to try and make it better

	- We are planning on making some more major changes to the way scores are tracked in the next week.  These changes will likely require that we reset the scores for all zones, just giving you a heads up.
