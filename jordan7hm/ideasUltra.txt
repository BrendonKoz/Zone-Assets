Random Brewery Spawns with turrets

When it destroys there's a bunch of beer that spawns
<_7hm> so lets say the brewery is spawned... once an hour
<lune> u go to the brewery and u have to activate it
<PSYCHOKILLER> hour - tolong
<_7hm> with turrets to defend
<_7hm> yeah
<PSYCHOKILLER> make 30min
<Sivaschin> computer controlled turrets*
<_7hm> and the team that activates it first gets to defend it
<Sivaschin> or pdb style?
<PSYCHOKILLER> i say auto
<_7hm> it will still be strong enough to live on its own for maybe 5 minutes with no team defending it
<demoship> make it so
<Sivaschin> are these brewery camps set in predefined locations?
<demoship> it produces 60 beer / hour, OR 12 beer immediately if you destroy it
<demoship> but if you want it to produce 60 beer / hour
<demoship> you have to "invest" 12 beer
<demoship> and if NME team destroys it
<_7hm> it costs beer to activate it
<demoship> tough
<Sivaschin> yeah, a gamble to between long term and short term gains
<Sivaschin> i like that
<_7hm> and once its activated, it doesnt drop beer
<_7hm> i like that


Cash Reward system

<_7hm> there's gotta be other ways
<_7hm> with the lua there are
<_7hm> ill add a Reward system
<lune> maybe put flags on the map or something
<_7hm> when you get 10 kills in a row, when you reach 200 kills, stuff like that
<lune> flags = $
<_7hm> you get 1 $

Wreckage

When you destroy buildings Junk is dropped that can be converted to BP
Tanks do too

Buyable brewery at high cost

Convert BP to beer at a loss

Implement population Limits for vehicles

yeah we'll make the # of vehicles allowed based on population size
<_7hm> maybe 1 heavy tank / team
<_7hm> 2 light tanks
