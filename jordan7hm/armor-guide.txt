~BGuide to Armor~B
-------------

There are many people who seem to have trouble understanding the armor
system of RPG, I'm making this guide to explain everything I
can about it. There are four main aspects
to armor:
-~BEnergy~B
-~BInnate protections~B
-~BArmor~B
-~BDamage Calculation~B

~B~4ENERGY~B~4
~2Your energy is one form of your armor. The current percent of your
energy you have left after the drain from being shot is how much the
damage is reduced by. Here's an example, say your powercell size is
600 and after you got hit by an AR it took your energy to 540.
540/600=.9 so that means your energy alone would take away 90% of the
damage from the bullet. In essence, the lower your energy, the more
damage you take. Keep in mind that there are armors which you can
purchase that will reduce the drain done by weapons as well.

~B~4INNATES~B~4
~2In Eol every class has an innate protection against one or several
damage types. The protection they give comes after energy and before
armor is calculated.

~B~4ARMOR~B~4
~2There are several aspects to armor that you need to know before I continue:

-~BSoft vs Hard protection~B: Soft protection (the percent number under
"Protection") reduces the damage by that percent. Hard armor (the
number under "Ignore-Damage") subtracts that much damage from a bullet
that hits you.

-~BTypes of armor~B: There are three types of armor: Soft, Composite, and
Hard. Soft armors consist of only percent protection. Composites have
both Hard ignore and Soft protection.
Hard armors only have Hard ignore.

-~BArmor order~B: Damage is reduced via your armor from top to bottom.
That makes it important to put your armor in an order that reduces the
damage best. The best way to do this is to figure out which of your
armors are Soft, Comp, and Hard then put the Softs at the top, Comps
in the middle, and Hards at the bottom. To rearrange your armor just
assign the piece you want to move to a key. Even if the key is taken
by something else you can switch it back to what is was on before and
it will stay in place.

Here's an example of the right order vs the wrong order of soft/hard armor:
Given that you have a 20 damage weapon, a piece of soft armor with 50%
protection, and a piece of hard armor with 5 ignore and that we're
excluding innates and energy protection.
-Hard above Soft(wrong):
20-5=15 damage
15*.5=7.5 damage

~BSoft above Hard(right)~B:
20*.5=10
10-5=5

~B~4DAMAGE CALCULATION~B~4
~2Now that you have the basics down let's do a full example of damage
reduction using everything I just showed. Here's what I'll be using, a
20 damage/60 shield drain AR vs a PF/Armored Boots/Vambrace -
Alloy/CMP6 Infantry. Keep in mind that the Infantry has a 5%
Kinetic innate and that the PF will reduce the drain of the weapon.
I'll do two rounds, one at high energy and one at low.

~BHigh~B: The Infantry currently has 500 energy, and after being hit by
the AR bullet is drained to 455 energy. (The PF generator reduces
energy drain by 25%.)
455/550=.827 1-.827=.173 (.173 is how much damage would be left after
the shot, while the .827 is how much damage would be removed)
20*.173=3.46
3.46*.95(Innate)=3.29
3.29*.85(PF)=2.8
2.8*.875(Boots)=2.45
2.45-1(Vamb)=1.45
1.45*.875(Vamb)=1.27
1.27-3(CMP6)=-2.27 damage which is counted as 0.
0*.77(CMP6)=0

~BLow~B: The Infantry currently has 100 energy, and after being hit by the
AR bullet is drained to 55 energy. (The PF generator reduces energy
drain by 25%.)
55/550=.1 1-.1=.9 (.9 is how much damage would be left after the shot,
while the .1 is how much damage would be removed)

20*.9=18
18*.95(Innate)=17.1
17.1*.85(PF)=14.54
14.54*.875(Boots)=12.72
12.72-1(Vamb)=11.72
11.72*.875(Vamb)=10.26
10.26-3(CMP6)=7.26
7.26*.77(CMP6)=5.59 damage
